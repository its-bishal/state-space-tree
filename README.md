The state space tree for the solution of 8 puzzle problem using DFS.
The project is an implementation of of state space tree representation for the 8 puzzle problem.
It includes a class State which represents each possible configuration of the board, and methods to generate all success

The implementation for the problem has been done using three algorithms
+ Depth First Search (DFS): It explores as far as possible along each branch
+ Breadth First Search (DFS): It explores  all branches equally before going on to the next one
+ A* search algorithm(manhattan distance): It uses heuristic function to estimate the cost from a given state
